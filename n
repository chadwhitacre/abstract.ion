            <h1>abstract.io/n</h1>

            <p><i>This is <a href="http://www.whit537.org">Chad Whitacre</a>'s
                philosophy website.  I am researching abstraction as a key to
                understanding neuroscience, metaphysics, and human
                culture.</i></p>

            <p><b>Thinking is abstraction. Abstraction is the trading off of
                information for power, for the sake of flourishing.</b></p>

            <p>When I cognize a computer screen as a collection of liquid
            crystals, I have before me detailed information concerning these
            crystals: their size, arrangement, power consumption, molecular
            properties, etc. I am sensitive to slight variations between one
            crystal and its neighbors. However, I cannot, while inspecting the
            LCD screen as a collection of crystals, use the computer. I perform
            an abstraction when I trade in my detailed view of the liquid
            crystal display for a cognition of the user interface it conveys.
            Now I can use the computer, though in exchange I have given up my
            awareness of the nuances of each individual crystal.</p>
            
            <p>This abstraction enables others in turn. From the cognition or
            awareness of a user interface as such, I turn my attention to the
            cognition of application windows on the screen. I abstract from
            windows on a screen and cognize a web page. Processing the visual
            design of the web page, I zero in on a passage of text. I focus my
            attention on the letters and punctuation. From these, I cognize
            words. Words yield to grammatical constructions. Grammar gives way
            to propositions. I take these propositions and fit them variously
            into my worldview. At each step, I have traded in the opportunity
            for detailed knowledge at a lower level for the benefit to be
            gained from the higher level.</p>

            <p>The benefit of performing an abstraction is this: it enables
            further abstractions. Digital circuits and analog circuits share a
            common root in electromagnetism and the fundamentals of circuits.
            However, the digital abstraction yields computers, while the analog
            abstraction yields only cassette tapes. The former abstraction is
            more fruitful than the latter. An element of the lower level thus
            benefits from participating in a fruitful abstraction by continuing
            to exist. Who uses cassette tapes any more?</p>


            <h2>Applying Abstraction</h2>

            <p>If indeed abstraction is the basic principle of human cognition,
            then it would be expected that cognitive neuroscience would unveil
            the mechanisms of abstraction in our minds/brains. Furthermore, it
            would be expected that abstraction can unify the explanation of all
            phenomena of human culture, because these all have cognition at
            their root. So all cultural projects, from art to religion to
            science to philosophy to government, would be able to be more
            elegantly reformulated in terms of abstraction. Lastly, we would
            expect a general, popular understanding of abstraction to
            contribute to the further flourishing of our culture/species.</p>
